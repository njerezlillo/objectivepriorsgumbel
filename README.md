# Selection of objective priors for Gumbel distribution parameters with application to maximum rainfall data

## Application:
1.- "post-jeff.R": Contains the script for the results of Bayesian inference using the Jeffreys prior.

2.- "post-reference-mle.R": Contains the script for the results of Bayesian inference using the Jeffreys prior and Classical inference using ML estimators, respectively.

3.- "qqplot-jeff.R": Contains the script for qqplots used in the application section.

4.- "df_1947_2023.xls": Corresponds to the database used.

## Simulation Study.
1.- "simu-final.R": Contains the programming for the figures in the simulation study.

2.- "boxplots.R": Contains the boxplot programming in the appendix section.

3.- "simu1.RData": Contains the chains and geweke tests obtained in scenario 1 of the simulation study.

4.- "simu2.RData": Contains the chains and geweke tests obtained in scenario 2 of the simulation study.

5.- "simu3.RData": Contains the chains and geweke tests obtained in scenario 3 of the simulation study.
